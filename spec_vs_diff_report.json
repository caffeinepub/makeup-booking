  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to both frontend and backend files consistent with restoring an earlier version of the application. The backend/main.mo and numerous frontend components have been modified. However, the diff is heavily truncated (36 of 56 modified files are omitted due to limits), making it impossible to fully verify all changes. The visible changes appear consistent with a version restoration effort, but completeness cannot be confirmed.",
